These are brief instructions on adding content to the webpage.

## Content management

Content should be in the form of a markdown file and will likely fall in one of three catgories

*   Documentation stored under /docs/docs/
*   Tutorials stored under /docs/tutorials/
*   News, stored under /docs/_posts

Where the file is stored is for conevenience and clarity rather than any functionality.

## Markdown file headers

Jekyll will build the site based on the headers provided at the top of in each file.

Some important keys in the headers are 

*   layout : this specifies which layout template to use.
*   title : specifies the page title
*   permalink : specifies the subpath for where the generated html file will be
*   site_nav_category : For pages with a sidebar, this is a tag that 
    1) specifies that there should be a side bar, and 2) will create the sidebar
    based on other files with the same label *unless* the following key is true
*   is_site_nav_category : This should be reserved for the landing page of the 
    main navigational bar. It prevents the sidebar from creating an entry for 
    this page.
*   site_nav_category_order : number that will be used to sort sidebar elements
*   is_site_nav_category2 : Designates this page should appear emphasized in the 
    sidebar (looks like a parent of the subsequent elements). Note that the 
    sorting is still goverened by site_nav_category_order. 

### Example docs/tutorials headers

Main landing page for docs

'''
---
layout: page
title: Title
permalink: /docs/index.html
site_nav_category: docs
is_site_nav_category: true
---
'''

Parent docs page

'''
---
layout: page
title: Documentation example
permalink: /docs/example.html
site_nav_category: docs
site_nav_category_order: 100
is_site_nav_category2: true
---
'''

Child docs page

'''
---
layout: page
title: Documentation example
permalink: /docs/example1.html
site_nav_category: docs
site_nav_category_order: 101
---
'''

### Example news header and filename convention:

'''
---
layout: post
title: My news item title
---
'''

In order to auto-generate the timestamp for posts, the individual markdown files 
should also follow the file naming format of: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP

For example, "2016-12-15-mobly-website-is-live.md"

## Generating the site locally

github-pages is responsible for generating the static site. For development and 
debugging purposes build the jekyll site locally by following 
https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/.
