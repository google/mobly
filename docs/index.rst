Welcome to Mobly's documentation!
=================================

**Mobly** is a Python-based test framework that specializes in supporting
test cases that require multiple devices, complex environments, or custom
hardware setups.

Here are some example use cases:

* P2P data transfer between two devices
* Conference calls across three phones
* Wearable device interacting with a phone
* Internet-of-Things devices interacting with each other
* Testing RF characteristics of devices with special equipment
* Testing LTE network by controlling phones, base stations, and eNBs

Mobly can support many different types of devices and equipment, and it's
easy to plug your own device or custom equipment/service into Mobly.

Mobly comes with a set of libraries to control common devices like Android
devices.

While developed by Googlers, Mobly is not an official Google product.
