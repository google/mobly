# Mobly Release History

## Mobly Release 1.8.1: Fix Final Cleanup Stage Error Capture

### Fixes
* Errors from the final clean up stage are now properly recorded.
  * NOTE: This may expose errors that have long existed in your tests. They are
    usually caused by your test interrupting controller object life cycle
    management. Fixing these issues would help keep your test env clean.
* Fixed docs config so `http://mobly.readthedocs.io` show all the classes
  properly.


## Mobly Release 1.8: Controller Management and `AndroidDevice` Service

### New
* Modularized controller management logic by introducing `ControllerManager`.
* Introduced the service mechanism in `AndroidDevice`, life cycles management
  of long-running processes for Android devices.
* Convenience method for creating per-test adb logcat
  `logcat.create_per_test_excerpt`.
* `AdbError` now has `serial` as a direct attribute.

### Deprecated
The following APIs in `AndroidDevice` are deprecated:
* `start_services` -> `ad.services.start_all`
* `stop_services` -> `ad.services.stop_all`
* `start_adb_logcat` -> `ad.services.logcat_start`
* `stop_adb_logcat` -> `ad.services.logcat_stop`

### Fixes
* `expects` APIs crashing in certain execution stages.
* `setup_class`'s record is not recorded correctly in summary yaml.
* Controller info recoding
* adb logcat crashes

  Fixes
