# Mobly Release History


## Mobly Release 1.12: New Snippet Base Client and a New `pre_run` Stage

This release introduces the new generic Mobly snippet base client and the new
Android snippet client built on top. The new snippet base enables us to better
scale Mobly snippets across various platforms.

The old Android snippet client is now considered deprecated, and will be
removed in the following release. Please update your code accordingly:
* `snippet_client` -> `snippet_client_v2`
* `snippet_event` -> `mobly.snippet.callback_event`
* `callback_handler` -> `callback_handler_v2`

The `generate_setup_tests` stage is renamed to `pre_run` to better reflect its
true role: steps that happen before all the test case methods are finalized.
This is a pure rename with no functional changes. Please migrate your code as
the `generate_setup_tests` stage will stop working completely in the next
release.

### New
* Added the new Mobly snippet base client.
* Added the new Android snippet client v2 based on the new base client.
* Support changing Mobly's logger level to `DEBUG` via cli arg.
* Termination signal type is now included in result records.

### Breaking Changes
* The old Android snippet client is deprecated.
* The `generate_setup_tests` stage is now `pre_run`.

### Fixes
* Various issues in the Android snippet client.

## Mobly Release 1.11: Py2 Deprecation and Repeat/Retry Support

code removal.

Py2-specific workarounds and deprecated APIs are removed in this release.
We are also refactoring to use 2-space indentation and unit test system.

### New
* Framework support for test case level `repeat` and `retry`.

### Breaking Changes
* Removal of Py2 support
* Removal of the `monsoon` controller

## Mobly Release 1.10.1: Incremental fixes

This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

### New
* API for taking screenshots in `AndroidDevice`

## Mobly Release 1.10: Framework and `AndroidDevice` Output Improvements

*This is likely the last major release that preserves Py2 compatibility.*

### New
* `AndroidDevice` now has a new `is_emulator` property.
* Better multi-user support in `AndroidDevice`.
* Standardized logging and output file names.
* Improvement in `utils.concurrent_exec`.
* Support class-based decorator on Mobly test methods.

### Breaking Changes
Due to the standardization of output files for both Mobly and `AndroidDevice`
controller, if you have custom parser of Mobly outputs, you need to adjust
your parsing logic to accommodate the changes.

* Major change in output directory structure #650
* Names of `AndroidDevice`'s output files have been standardized #633
* Changed multiple references of `test_bed` to `testbed` in code #641

### Fixes
* `AndroidDevice`'s service manager behavior for reboot and USB disconnect.

## Mobly Release 1.9: UID Support; `AndroidDevice` and General Runner Improvements

### New
* Support specifying Unique Identifier (UID) for both static and generated test
  methods.

### Breaking Changes

* [Deprecation] Code path for passing args directly into a test method, which
  was never used.

  including `AndroidDevice#load_sl4a`.

### Fixes
* Bug fixes and reliability improvements in `AdbProxy`.
* Improved APIs for taking bugreports
* Improvements in `AndroidDevice` service management
* Improvements in `AndroidDevice`'s `getprop` calls, including caching.

## Mobly Release 1.8.1: Fix Final Cleanup Stage Error Capture

### Fixes
* Errors from the final clean up stage are now properly recorded.
  * NOTE: This may expose errors that have long existed in your tests. They are
    usually caused by your test interrupting controller object life cycle
    management. Fixing these issues would help keep your test env clean.
* Fixed docs config so `http://mobly.readthedocs.io` show all the classes
  properly.


## Mobly Release 1.8: Controller Management and `AndroidDevice` Service

### New
* Modularized controller management logic by introducing `ControllerManager`.
