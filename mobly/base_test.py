    This class gets all the controller objects from test_runner and executes
    the tests requested within itself.

    Most attributes of this class are set at runtime based on the configuration
    provided.

    The default logger in logging module is set up for each test run. If you
    want to log info to the test run output file, use `logging` directly, like
    `logging.info`.

    Attributes:
        tests: A list of strings, each representing a test method name.
        TAG: A string used to refer to a test class. Default is the test class
            name.
        results: A records.TestResult object for aggregating test results from
            the execution of tests.
        current_test_name: [Deprecated, use `self.current_test_info.name`]
            A string that's the name of the test method currently being
            executed. If no test is executing, this should be None.
        current_test_info: RuntimeTestInfo, runtime information on the test
            currently being executed.
        log_path: string, specifies the root directory for all logs written
            by a test run.
        test_bed_name: string, the name of the test bed used by a test run.
        controller_configs: dict, configs used for instantiating controller
            objects.
        user_params: dict, custom parameters from user, to be consumed by
            the test logic.
        register_controller: func, used by test classes to register
            controller modules.
